/**
 * An implementation of a complete binary tree by means of a linked structure
 * (LinkedBinaryTree). The LinkedBinaryTree class takes care of most of the
 * "mechanics" of modifying the tree (you should read through the NDS4
 * documentation in order to fully understand how this class works), but you
 * will need to think about how to implement a CompleteBinaryTree such that
 * additions and removals operate *only* on the last node (hint: think about
 * other useful data structures). You must also ensure that you do not violate
 * the assignment runtime requirements when deciding how you will track nodes
 * within the tree.
 * 
 * Feel free to add additional comments.
