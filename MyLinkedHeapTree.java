/**
 * An implementation of a complete binary tree by means 
 * of a linked structure (LinkedBinaryTree). The LinkedBinaryTree class 
 * takes care of most of the "mechanics" of modifying 
 * the tree (you should read through the NDS4 documentation 
 * in order to fully understand how this class works), but you will need 
 * to think about how to implement a CompleteBinaryTree such that
 * additions and removals operate *only* on the last node (hint: think
 * about other useful data structures). You must also ensure that you do not
 * violate the assignment runtime requirements when deciding how you will
 * track nodes within the tree.
 * 
 * Feel free to add additional comments.
